# bun-react-tailwind-template
Created with my brain and github copilot in agent mode.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To start a development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

To run for production:

```bash
bun start
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.10. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
